## Featured Projects

### üîç [FTP Data Exfiltration Investigation](https://github.com/paigealfred/ftp-exfiltration-investigation)
**Tools:** Elastic SIEM, Zeek, Wireshark, Docket

Comprehensive investigation of unauthorized file transfer to external infrastructure. Reconstructed complete attack timeline from initial SMB access through FTP exfiltration with precise timestamps.

**Key Results:**
- Traced sensitive document from internal host (172.16.100.3) to external IP (85.93.20.10)
- Analyzed PCAP traffic and identified exact exfiltration timestamp (12:17:15 UTC)
- Correlated SMB file access with FTP transfer using multi-tool analysis
- Documented full attack chain with protocol-level details

---

### üö® [SSH Brute Force Detection](https://github.com/paigealfred/splunk-ssh-brute-force-detection)
**Tools:** Splunk, SPL

Built correlation search to detect SSH brute force attacks by identifying patterns of failed login attempts followed by successful authentication.

**Key Results:**
- Engineered SPL queries to analyze 300+ authentication events
- Created real-time alerting for automated SOC escalation
- Developed detection logic correlating failed and successful logins
- Implemented proactive monitoring for authentication-based attacks

---

### üåê [Network Scan Forensics Investigation](https://github.com/paigealfred/network-scan-forensics)
**Tools:** Wireshark, Docket

Deep dive PCAP analysis investigating network reconnaissance activity. Used TCP stream reconstruction to trace scan results and identify communication endpoints.

**Key Results:**
- Isolated scan traffic between compromised host and external IP
- Followed TCP streams to reconstruct complete session data
- Identified final scan target (172.16.100.253) before connection termination
- Demonstrated targeted PCAP filtering to reduce noise

---

### üõ°Ô∏è [Suricata IDS Alert Analysis](https://github.com/paigealfred/suricata-ids-analysis)
**Tools:** Suricata, Elastic

Analyzed large-scale IDS alert dataset to identify signature patterns and validate detection coverage across network traffic.

**Key Results:**
- Analyzed 109,487 alerts for specific signature pattern
- Used correlation filters to isolate traffic between specific hosts
- Demonstrated understanding of alert severity levels and prioritization
- Showed ability to work with high-volume security telemetry

---

### üìä [DNS Log Analysis & Field Extraction](https://github.com/paigealfred/splunk-dns-log-analysis)
**Tools:** Splunk, SPL

Ingested and normalized DNS log data to identify communication patterns and potential anomalies through custom field extraction and aggregation.

**Key Results:**
- Created custom field extractions for source IPs, destinations, and domains
- Built SPL queries to aggregate and visualize DNS communication patterns
- Transformed raw log data into structured analysis format
- Demonstrated log parsing and data normalization skills

---

### üìÅ [SMB Lateral Movement Investigation](https://github.com/paigealfred/smb-lateral-movement-investigation)
**Tools:** Elastic SIEM, Zeek

Traced internal file access patterns using SMB protocol analysis to identify origin point of sensitive document before external exfiltration. Demonstrated multi-stage attack investigation tracking lateral movement within enterprise network.

**Key Results:**
- Identified SMB protocol as internal file access method before FTP exfiltration
- Traced sensitive document movement from internal host (172.16.100.3) to external server
- Mapped complete attack chain from internal access to external data theft
- Applied KQL file tracking queries to investigate file movement across network protocols

---

### üîê [Multi-Protocol C2 Detection](https://github.com/paigealfred/multi-protocol-c2-detection)
**Tools:** Elastic SIEM, Zeek, Wireshark

Identified concurrent SSL/TLS encrypted C2 channel coordinating FTP data exfiltration between same hosts. Demonstrated advanced protocol correlation to detect attacker OPSEC using separate command and control infrastructure.

**Key Results:**
- Discovered SSL/TLS encrypted session operating alongside FTP exfiltration (same source/destination)
- Correlated protocol timing to determine SSL connection was C2 channel coordinating FTP transfers
- Analyzed multi-protocol attack infrastructure showing attacker operational security
- Demonstrated ability to expand investigation beyond single-protocol analysis
